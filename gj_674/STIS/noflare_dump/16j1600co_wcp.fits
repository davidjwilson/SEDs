HISTORY   This is an initial wavecal parameters table, based largely on         HISTORY   the values that were previously hard-coded in calstis4.               HISTORY   Observational data were not directly used in deciding what            HISTORY   values to assign to these parameters, though some (such as            HISTORY   search ranges) have been modified from earlier values to              HISTORY   improve the chances that calstis4 would succeed.                      HISTORY   See ISR 96-019 and ISR 98-12 for information about how                HISTORY   calstis4 works.                                                       HISTORY   wcp.fits renamed to j331721io_wcp.fits on Mar 3 1999                                                                                                  HISTORY   Starting with calstis version 2.6, a different algorithm              HISTORY   is used for processing echelle wavecals.  The shifts are              HISTORY   determined directly from the flat-fielded data, instead of            HISTORY   from the 2-D rectified data.  The MOFFSET1 and MOFFSET2               HISTORY   keywords are not used at all; calstis4 determines the total           HISTORY   shift and records the values in SHIFTA1 and SHIFTA2.  The             HISTORY   nominal SHIFTAi values previously were zero, but now they             HISTORY   will typically be the same as the MOFFSETi values, which              HISTORY   can be as large as 21 for MOFFSET1 and 42 for MOFFSET2, in            HISTORY   absolute value.  The search ranges WL_RANGE and SP_RANGE              HISTORY   for MAMA data have been increased to accommodate the range            HISTORY   of MOFFSETi values.                                                                                                                                   HISTORY   For echelle data, only the WL_TRIM1 and WL_TRIM2 values are           HISTORY   used to exclude data around the borders.  The shifts in both          HISTORY   the dispersion and spatial directions are now determined at           HISTORY   the same time, so two separate sets of parameters (one set for        HISTORY   each direction) are not needed.  These parameters were given          HISTORY   new values; only 10 pixels will be excluded at the borders.                                                                                           HISTORY   WL_TRIM2 and SP_TRIM1 were decreased to 10 (which usually             HISTORY   overlaps the border for first-order data), because the                HISTORY   dispersion relation and spectral trace are believed to be             HISTORY   sufficiently accurate to very near the edges of the detectors.        HISTORY   new1_wcp.fits renamed to k291025go_wcp.fits on Feb 9 2000             HISTORY   A new row was added for OPT_ELEM = PRISM.  For this row,              HISTORY   WL_TRIM2 is large, leaving only a narrow strip along the              HISTORY   middle for determining the shift in the dispersion direction.         HISTORY   SP_RANGE is also larger, because a large offset in the                HISTORY   cross-dispersion direction was noted for o68h01050.
